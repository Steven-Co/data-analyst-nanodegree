The dataset that I chose for this project was the Ford GoBike dataset. The Ford GoBike program is a bike share system in the Bay Area that operates on either a pay per use or subscription based model. The dataset was divided into a section for each month of 2018. Combined, the dataset contained 1,863,721 observations with 16 features before cleaning and updating. After making some changes such as removing rows with null and erroneous birth years, adding distance information, and adding columns regarding the day of week of each ride, the dataset contained 1,752,127 observations with 19 features. ### Summary Findings: I discovered that an overwhelming number of the rides conducted using the GoBike service are by individuals born in the 80's or after. This are distribution is largely unimodal. Additionally the data shows that a sizable majority of rides are undertaken by male users followed by females and those choosing to identify as other. Ride durations see their highest concentrations between 100 and 3,000 seconds, peaking between 400 and 900 seconds. The data also showed that a significantly larger portion of rides are conducted under subscription plans rather than customers paying per ride or per day. This is also true of people not involved with the Bike Share for All program as there are far more rides not using this service than those that are. The GoBike data also suggests that there is a relationship between younger users and higher usage as most rides are carried out by individuals claiming to be born from the 80's onward. This is true across all gender groups (male, female, other). On average, females tend to have longer ride durations (around 901 seconds) followed by other (around 867 seconds) and then male (around 733 seconds). Among user types, across the board between genders the subscription model accounted for an overwhelming majority of rides during this time (around 1.4 million trips). This was also true of non Bike Share for All trips making vast majority of trips (around 1.4 million trips). On both start and end days for trips, the highest times of activity occurred between Monday and Friday with the weekends seeing a significant drop-off in trips taken. This holds true for all gender groups. For distance covered between start and end stations, age played a role in both in the number of rides and distance traveled as younger riders tended to have more rides and traveled further for all genders. The heaviest concentration of rides was 3 miles and under. For ride duration by gender and age, as was the case in other observations there is a positive relationship with age and duration with younger riders riding for longer periods for all gender groups. Females had a significant spike near the early 80's birth years for longer ride durations. ### Chosing results for explanatory presentation. I focussed on the main areas I felt were important with service usage which were age, gender, day of week, duration, and distance. In using a countplot at the outset I was able to show the numerical breakdown of rides per gender. To show how heavily skewed towards younger riders the data was, I made a histogram with binsizes of one for each year. Now that the viewer was a aware of how many rides by gender actually took place, giving the viewer a clearer understanding of the age by gender makeup of the data with a boxplot made sense as it is easy to understand and derive insight from. A horizontal barplot does a good job showing the differences in ride duration by gender. For ride volume per day, I feel a line plot could have worked here rather than a countplot. However time range was small, just one week, and a countplot still effectively drives home the information that the viewer is likely to want. Distance by gender and age using heatmaps does a much better job displaying concentration of points than a scatterplot so it was selected for this purpose.
